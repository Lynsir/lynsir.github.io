abstract: >-
  Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has attracted much attention for its good performance and simple structure in recent years. However, its solution search equation does well in exploration but badly in exploitation, which may result in slow convergence rate for complex optimization problems. To address this defect, many ABC variants have been developed based on utilizing the global best individual or the group of elite individuals. Although the utilization of such good individuals is indeed beneficial to enhance the exploitation, it may also run the risk of causing the algorithm too greedy...
