abstract: >-
  Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has been shown good performance over many optimization problems. For some complex optimization problems, however, ABC often suffers from a slow convergence speed, because it is good at exploration but poor at exploitation. To achieve a better tradeoff between the exploration and exploitation capabilities, we introduce the breadth-first search (BFS) framework and depth-first search (DFS) framework into different phases of ABC respectively. The BFS framework is combined with the employed bee phase to focus on the exploration, while the DFS framework is integrated into the onlooker bee phase to concentrate on exploitation...
