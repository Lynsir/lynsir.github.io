  In this paper, we proposed a novel differential evolution (DE) variant with multi-information guidance. First, based on a rank-based method, the DE population is divided into three groups by using both of the fitness information and position information. Then three distinct combinations of mutation strategy and parameter settings are assigned to these three groups respectively. Last, a neighborhood search operator is conducted with the aim of using the neighborhood information. Experimental results on 22 well-known benchmark functions have shown the effectiveness of our approach.
