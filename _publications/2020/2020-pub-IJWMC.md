abstract: >-
  To enhance exploitation for artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, we propose a modified multi-strategy ABC variant in which a superior information learning strategy is employed. In this strategy, the individuals can learn superior information from an exemplar which has better fitness value, and the exemplar is no longer acted by the global best individual or the elite group. In experiments, 22 well-known test functions are used and six well-established ABC variants are involved in the comparison....
