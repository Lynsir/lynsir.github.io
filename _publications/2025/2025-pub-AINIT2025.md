abstract: >-
  Deep learning has achieved excellent results in the tumor image segmentation, and the application of the attention mechanism has made the model more powerful. In this paper, a novel Soft-Hard Method (SHM) is proposed, which can transform the current soft attention and possess some characteristics of hard attention...
