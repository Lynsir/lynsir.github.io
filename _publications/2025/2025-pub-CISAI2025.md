abstract: >-
  Pulmonary nodule segmentation is essential for early lung cancer diagnosis. However, conventional deep learning methods often suffer from high computational cost and limited feature adaptability. We propose a lightweight U- Net variant that integrates a Multi-Scale Coordinate Attention (MSCA) module with Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) to enhance multi-scale feature representation. To reduce complexity, Depthwise Separable Convolutions and Ghost Modules replace standard convolutions, while residual skip connections improve feature fusion.Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset show that our method achieves...
