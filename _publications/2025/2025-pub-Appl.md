abstract: >-
  Improving the accuracy of power load forecasting is an important link in the optimization of power systems. Most of the existing studies in the short-term load forecasting task at present have the problem of insufficient extraction of multi-scale features. Therefore, in order to improve prediction accuracy, this study designs a short-term power load forecasting model integrating multi-scale GCN and the improved Transformer, as well as the prediction method based on this model....
