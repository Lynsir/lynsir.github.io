abstract: >-
  Urban flood susceptibility has emerged as a critical challenge for cities worldwide, exacerbated by rapid urbanization. This study evaluates urban flood susceptibility under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in the context of urbanization. A coupled modeling approach integrating the System Dynamics (SD) model and the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model was employed to project future land use changes under sustainable development, moderate development, and conventional development scenarios...
