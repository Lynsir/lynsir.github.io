abstract: >-
  Enhanced comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (ECLPSO) is a metaheuristic recently proposed by us for global optimization. ECLPSO is balanced in exploration and exploitation; however, it still cannot satisfactorily address some complex multimodal problems. In this paper, we investigate further improving the exploration performance of ECLPSO through exemplar evolution (EE)...
